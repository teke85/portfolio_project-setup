> Build a personal portfolio site.

> The web page similar to the one in [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1)

#Project Detailed Requirements

You will build the middle section of the mobile website. This sections of the mobile website should include:

"Works" section

the "About myself" section (placed after the projects and before the contact form):

> In order to lay out the elements in "Works" section you should use CSS Grid and Flexbox combined (it is mandatory that you use both). Use CSS Grid in the main container that contains all of the cards and use Flexbox to lay out an individual card.

> Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
